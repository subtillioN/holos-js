#Holos-JS
Holos-JS is an ongoing repository for my continued learning of JavaScript. Very much a work in progress, some of which will consist of converting various classes from my Holos-AS (ActionScript) project.  

In essence, holos aims to be a general project or application development library or framework

##TODO
* integrate architect
